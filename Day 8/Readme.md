Here is the Python program to calculate the area of a circle:

```
import math

radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)

print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is: {area:.2f} square units")
```

This program:

1. Imports the math module for the pi constant.
2. Asks for the radius of the circle.
3. Calculates the area using the formula Ï€r^2.
4. Prints the result, rounded to two decimal places.

Run this program and enter the radius to calculate the area of the circle!
